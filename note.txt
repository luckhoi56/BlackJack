What is AJAX?
Javascript technique for communicating with web services
-stands for "Async Javascript and XML"
-does not really need xml, can use plain text or json
-provide the base functionalify for js scripts that need to use rest services

-event based, ajax ins asynchronous

*ajax has ready state indicates the status of the request, also contains the status code of the response.

AJAX: Common steps to send an XHR

1. create the XHR object

2. set the onreadystatechange function:
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
        if (xhr.readyState == 4){
            /*do stuff*/
        }
    }
3.set header if necessary:
    xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type","application/json")
4.open the request
    xhr.open("POST","http://website.com/people/",true)
5. send the request, with a body applicable
    xhr.send(JSON.stringify(bodyObject))

AJAX ready states:

0: unsent - object created but has not been opened

1:oepene
2:headers_recevied: send() is called and the request headers_recevied
3.loading: request being processed
4.

A simpler way: the fetch api
-the fetch api simplifies the request
-instead, the fetch api and its fetch() make use of promises

fetch('http://example.com/movies.json').then(response =>response.json())
